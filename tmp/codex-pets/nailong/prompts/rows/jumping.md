Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `nai-long`, state `jumping`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 5 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure cyan #00FFFF. Treat the row as 5 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: 界面显示名使用奶龙。以参考图中的黄色圆润小龙为唯一角色原型：大圆脑袋，短粗四肢，奶白色椭圆肚皮，绿色大眼睛，开心张嘴笑，头顶无角，背部无翅膀，手脚末端有棕色小爪；保留软萌3D玩具质感与憨厚亲近感。. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `3d-toy`: Stylized 3D toy mascot with smooth rounded forms, simple materials, clear silhouette, and no photoreal complexity. User style notes: 圆润软胶玩具质感，低细节，动作轮廓在小尺寸清晰；所有帧保持相同脸型、肚皮、眼睛和爪子。.
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Hover jump loop: anticipation, lift, airborne peak, descent, and settle through body height.

State requirements:
- Show the jump through pose and vertical body position only: anticipation, lift, airborne peak, descent, settle.
- Do not draw ground shadows, contact shadows, drop shadows, oval shadows, landing marks, dust, smears, bounce pads, or motion marks under the pet.
- Keep the background outside the pet perfectly flat chroma key with no darker key-colored patches.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.
